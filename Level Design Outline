Episode 1
1  Donkey pinata, big candy pile to start, longest time to finish
   Basic tap mechanic introduced, triple tap for candy multiplier

2  Donkey and pig
   toughness and speed introduced

3  Healthy pinatas, donkey, pig
   First 'enemy' introduced - veggies
   
4  Same as previous
   Introduce increased speed, encourage precision through avoiding veggies

5  Bunny - bungie cord
   First enemy pinata introduced
   Spawn more bunnies than healthy pinatas to get player to focus on new challenge
*a cool idea occured to me. what if you have to manage the kids weight - you don't want him to puke up candy so 
sometimes you want to hit veggie pinatas to calm him down.  This advanced strategy will help us extend the length of the game.

   encourage pile management - bunnies reduce pile vs. veggies reduce weight

Episode 3 - *we may need more features/pinata types.  I created these variations below which we could mix into the first two episodes
to spread everything out or we could keep it all here and make episode 3 the mishmash crazyfest it sounds like.

1  Ghost Pinatas - these should give more candy if hit.  I need another positive pinata -can't constantly be introducing more 
   bad pinatas.  

2  Bears and crocs only, the occasional bomb and candy ball

3  all ghosts - including enemies

4  Lots of donkeys but no other good pinata and every enemy type 

5  Attack of the squid - an onslaught of squid, baby and mama.  All good pinatas but tons of squid.

6  Few pinatas but lots of monkey appearances - use him wisely

7  Mostly gift boxes - it's a party 

8  tons of pinatas punctured by a wave of bombs to destroy everything

9  Everything on bungie cords

10 ???

11 ???

12  All pinata types, Fastest speed,shortest time
